## 4.

Optimization Impact: The optimized version generally shows a decrease in the number of executed floating-point operations compared to the non-optimized version. This reduction is observed across various vectorized instruction events.

Vectorization: Both versions show a significant number of executed packed single-precision SSE floating-point operations (r1010), indicating successful vectorization.

Scalar Operations: The number of scalar single-precision SSE floating-point operations (r1020) is 0 for both versions, suggesting efficient use of vectorization without resorting to scalar operations.

The optimized version generally executes fewer floating-point operations across different instruction types, indicating potential performance improvements.
