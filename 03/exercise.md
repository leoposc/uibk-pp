# Assignment 2

## Exercise 1

### Improve program performance

Make usage of compiler optimazations.

### Parallelize

Divide the array in vertically sliced stripes and assign the strips to ranks.



## Exercise 2

    While the results perf seem to be very fluctuant and therefore not really reliable and the results of the self written functions also flawed, cachegrind seems to be the only program which delivers solid results. Still it is surprising that cachegrind gives us the same results for both implementations of the hadamard matrix multiplication.
